# Welcome to Defold

This project was created from the "mobile" project template. This means that the settings in [game.project](defold://open?resource=/game.project) have been changed to be suitable for a mobile game:

- The screen size is set to 640x1136
- A custom render script is used with options for stretched, fit or fixed
  projection
- iOS launch images (blank ones) are set
- Android and iOS icons are set
- Accelerometer input is turned off for better battery life
- Single touch input and mouse click is bound to action "touch"
- A simple script receives and reacts to input

[Build and run](defold://build) to see it in action. You can of course alter these settings to fit your needs.

Check out [the documentation pages](https://defold.com/learn) to learn how Defold works. If you run into trouble, help is available in [our forum](https://forum.defold.com).

Happy Defolding!
